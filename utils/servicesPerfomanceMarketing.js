From the perspective of your business, your product may offer a near-perfect set of features and be easy to use. If you dig a little deeper, you may find that customers are using the product in a different context, looking for missing features or not using the most valuable ones because they are hidden from their eyes, experiencing pain trying to find their way, or losing interest because the process takes too long. They can tolerate it all as long as they don't have an alternative, but once they do, you run the risk of losing much of your customer base. A comprehensive understanding of your customers' functional, personal and business goals - creating a user experience that solves them elegantly, leaving your customers happy with not only the results they expected, but even those they didn't - is key to developing winning products. We'll help you research, prototype and develop a product that's valuable to its users and highly effective for your business.",
